	This is the bit where I write a little bit about myself, to give my many adoring fans something to memorize obsessively. I was born in Virginia, but have lived on Long Island for as long as I can remember. I have two pet reptiles, because they are pretty independent, like cats, and they aren't pure evil, unlike cats. I like it when it snows, because fresh snow kind of mutes that constant background noise you hear when you go outside... and I like to throw snow. The rain is nice too, the sound of rain helps me sleep, which I definitely need more of. Between classes, work, other work, and general adult stuff I have to do now (dude growing up is super lame) restful sleep periods are few and far between. Alright, so I'm running out of information about myself that I'm willing to share, so I'm just going to write a little of this and a little of that, just mostly nonsense, to make this whole thing look like a giant, intimidating wall of text that you probably will not read. <br><br>Note to self, write more here.

If I do not respond within a few hours, something has gone very wrong. Go to your local post office, and find the nearest big blue postbox. Knock three times on the left side (my left, not yours), then drop a green painted brick on the inside. Drive home, and go to the drain of your sink. Whisper "Oh boy, I sure do love those mosquitoes" into it, and then place both hands on your head. When you hear the bird in the drain, you may remove your hands from you head, for help has been deployed. God help us all.
